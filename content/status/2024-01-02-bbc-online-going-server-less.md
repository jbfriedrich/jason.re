Very detailed write-up from the people that run *BBC Online*. They made the decision in 2020 to go server-less and have written about their reasoning and their experiences a year and a half later:

1. [Moving BBC Online to the cloud](https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/moving-bbc-online-to-the-cloud-afdfb7c072ff)
2. [Delivering BBC Online using serverless](https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/delivering-bbc-online-using-serverless-79d4a9b0da16)
3. [BBC Online - Refactoring the organisation](https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/refactor-organisation-80e4e171d922)
4. [BBC Online - A year with serverless](https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/bbc-online-a-year-with-serverless-ffc2ae474277)

Really quite an interesting read!
