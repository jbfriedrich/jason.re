My [Synology DS1815+](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS1815+) now has [16 GB](https://www.alternate.de/Crucial/SO-DIMM-16GB-DDR3-1600-Mac-Kit-Arbeitsspeicher/html/product/1080357) of memory. Thanks to [Mike Tabor](https://miketabor.com/about/), who tried it as one of the first and wrote a [blog post](https://miketabor.com/how-to-upgrade-synology-ds1815-16gb-ram/) about it.
