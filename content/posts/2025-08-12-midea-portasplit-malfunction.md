I guess I bragged too much with my new AC unit and the universe did not like it very much. After it worked fine for quite a while, the temperature went down and I stowed it away for the last couple of weeks – resting up and waiting for the next heatwave.

Yesterday, I decided to set it up again – a little test run for today's heat and the even hotter day tomorrow. The app reported water in the inner unit, which was weird as it usually pumps the condensed water into the outer unit, where it is released every now and then. I did not pay much attention to it, though. I thought it was due to the fact that it was stowed away, probably some water that was still in the system and ran back into the tray.

But that assumption was wrong – of course!

After I set it up today, the app quickly reported the same error. But this time, I was more attentive. Instead of the temperature, the display of the unit showed the dreaded "P1" error. Fuck! NO! Older units sold in 2023 and 2024 had a lot of "P1" issues. The little hose that transported the condensed water was easily bent and quickly blocked. Midea's engineers fixed it in a new revision, and every unit sold after March '25 should not have that issue anymore. I got mine in June, so I thought I would be safe.

I sent all required information to their support and now I am waiting for a technician to schedule an appointment with me. Just the scheduling can take up to five business days, and only god knows when I will have the actual appointment...

To survive the current heatwave, I had to "MacGyver" a solution that involves a wooden bench, a garden hose and some mop bucket. It ain't pretty, but it works! For now that is all I care about.
