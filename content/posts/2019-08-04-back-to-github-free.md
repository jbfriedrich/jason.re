Now that [GitHub is owned by Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/), free accounts can have unlimited private repositories. Before the acquisition, this feature was only available to "Pro" accounts. That, and the fact that I like to support companies which products I use, was the main factor for me to have a paid account.

I am no full-time developer, and I do not need all the collaboration features GitHub offers. So I just cancelled my subscription.

And now that GitHub is a part of Microsoft, one of the most valuable companies in the world, I dont feel bad not supporting them with my money. üòÅ
