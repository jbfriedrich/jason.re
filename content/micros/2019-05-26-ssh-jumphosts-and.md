I am now working with Linux for more than 20 years, but I have never, ever encountered the [ProxyJump](https://www.tecmint.com/access-linux-server-using-a-jump-host/) or the [ProxyCommand](https://ma.ttias.be/use-jumphost-ssh-client-configurations/) SSH client configuration options before. They make life so much easier for some of the environments I have to connect to!
