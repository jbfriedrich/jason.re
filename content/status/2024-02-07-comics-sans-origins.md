Thomas Steeles [has unearthed](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/thomas-steeles-comic-sans-is-it-really-that-bad-publication-graphic-design-extract-310124) the origins and first use of the "Comic Sans" font. I always wanted to know who invented that abomination of a font and what it was designed for. I think we all used it with Microsoft Word's "WordArt" in one document or another.
