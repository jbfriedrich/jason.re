When I received the new company Apple Silicon MacBook Pro, I started to use [Microsoft Edge](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjb1tivoOnvAhVVhP0HHUXcDcUQFjAAegQICBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fedge&usg=AOvVaw00nqzEG85NzCdwPK1TK20-) for work instead of my old default: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). I thought it would be a good idea, as we are making heavy use Office365 Enterprise, but I did not want to miss the features and compatibility the the Chromium engine offers.

So far the transition has been very smooth, but one thing drives me crazy. Whenever you copy and paste a link from Edge, [it tries to be smart](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/announcing-a-new-way-to-paste-urls-link-format/m-p/1600094) and adds a link with the title of the page as link text â€” instead of the plaintext URL. 

So fucking annoying! Thank god you can [change the default behavior](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/improved-copy-and-paste-of-urls-in-microsoft-edge-d3bd3956-603a-0033-1fbc-9588a30645b4).
