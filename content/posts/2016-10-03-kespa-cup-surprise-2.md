For the first time in **16 years** a foreigner has made it to the quarter finals of a Korean StarCraft 2 tournament. That alone would have been impressive enough, but [Neeb](https://twitter.com/onfireneeb) did not only do that. No, he also **won** the fucking thing!

If you are interesting in ESports in general and StarCraft 2 in particular, take look at the [VODs on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-uRIJPCxHjffqlil5hkuZkeIHSqCkcq8). I would recommend watching at least the semifinals and the finals (finals embedded below).
