Shit, I am feeling really old today. [macOS was released 20 years ago](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/24/mac-os-x-launch-20th-anniversary/). Of course, it was called "Mac OS X" back then ðŸ˜„.

I never worked with MacOS 9 myself, but I rembember driving to DÃ¼sseldorf to get one of the first copies of MacOS X Tiger in 2005. Back then I had a PowerPC Mac Mini. I remember feeling excited. After years of using a Linux desktop system, it was great to finally have a well-designed graphical user interface, but at the same, don't miss out on the powerful UNIX tools.

Nowadays Windows has caught up a lot with "[Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)" and their increased support for Open Source software and services. But Apple has a revival of their with their new ARM hardware â€” even though macOS Big Sur is not so great ðŸ˜ž.
