I have used a lot of blogging solutions in the past and went through quite a few applications. From Wordpress to Octopress, to Ghost and back. None of them had all the features I wanted. Now I might have found what I was looking for. Maybe...

I am not really happy with the blogging platforms out there. I went with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) for a while, but its transition from a "blogging platform" into a general "web site platform" is almost completed. Too complex, too bloated for my little needs. It is not what I am looking for, nor what I need.

I also tried [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) for a while, but I really do not like the new editor and the underlying [Mobiledoc format](https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit). I still like the project, and version 3.0 is really nice. But also not what I am looking for.

I need something to write blog posts, short micro posts and post links with some comments or additional info. I want to write my content in Markdown and I want to have my posts in Markdown files to be able to migrate them into whatever I want. I also need control over how posts are displayed in the RSS feed.

Right now, I am trying [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). Not sure if I stick with it. It is near to what I want, but not 100%. I might use Django and create a small blog myself.
