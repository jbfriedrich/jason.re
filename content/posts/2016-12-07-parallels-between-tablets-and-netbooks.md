I definitely see parallels between the Netbook hype and the Tablet hype. It was new, it was exciting, it was the same but something different. It was smaller, and lightweight. But in the end people realised that they _do want_ certain hardware and they _do want_ to be more flexible and _do not_ want to have limited devices but rather a “one for all their needs”. Then technology did what it naturally does best: it _progressed_. Devices were lighter, smaller and manufacturers were able to put the new technology to good use!

The Netbook _was_ a fad. The Tablet _is_ a fad. The laptop or notebook device class will **remain**. But it will need to continue to evolve. [Asus](http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-3-UX390UA/), [Apple](http://www.apple.com/macbook/), [Lenovo](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/yoga-book?IPromoID=LEN202848) and last but not least [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface) have shown a lot of innovation over the last couple of years and will probably continue to do so. Especially Lenovo’s and Microsoft’s hybrid models show the users that they can have it all, the flexibility of a laptop, the lightness of a Netbook and the touch interface of a Tablet.

Why compromise?
