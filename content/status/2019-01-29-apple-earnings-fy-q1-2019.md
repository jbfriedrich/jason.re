Apple just released their [quarterly results](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/29/apple-1q-2019-results/) for the first fiscal quarter for 2019 (in the real world, that is Q4 2018). The results were as expected after the [warning](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/02/apple-lowers-q1-2019-revenue-guidance/) they issued late last year.

Some interesting tidbits from the telephone conference though. I would put them into the "No shit, Sherlock!" category:

* Tim, you think the phones might [have been a tad too expensive](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/29/tim-cook-price-a-factor-declining-sales/)? NO FUCKING WAY!
* Customers [hold on to their phones](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/29/apple-lower-upgrades-explanation/) because they are build well and are still "good enough". Really? And maybe because new ones are **fucking expensive** , too?

So they are now [lowering the prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/29/iphone-price-cuts-international-markets/) in some international markets, like China, Brazil and India. Fat chance they will do that in Europe, too. But who knows, they seem desperate.
