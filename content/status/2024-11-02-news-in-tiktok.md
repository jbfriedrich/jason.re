It's interesting and shocking that so many young voters [only now seem to look more into the candidates and what they stand for](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/31/tiktok-trump-access-hollywood-gen-z/)! The election campaign is going for a while now, the internet is full of information about Trump and his fascist and sexist behavior. Or maybe it was just not visible on their social media platform of choiceâ€¦ ðŸ¤”

It is wild to me that there are 18 to 21 year olds out there who seem to get their whole "news" from TikTok. This shows once more to me that social networks need to be regulated - kind of like a tv network, a newspaper or an online magazine. They are responsible for the content on their publishing platform once they reach a certain size and have a lot of users - especially when they use algorithms. They should be liable for all the scams, fake ads, the fake news, the lies and propaganda.
