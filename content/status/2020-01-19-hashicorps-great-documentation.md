Kudos [HashiCorp](https://hashicorp.com)! I have to say, your Consul [documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/) is the best documentation I have read in a while.

In just a couple of hours I got all the basics I needed to have my own little Consul data center up and running, including certificates and secure communication between the nodes. [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/) needs to step up their game!

Next stop: [Vault](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault), using Consul as a backend.
