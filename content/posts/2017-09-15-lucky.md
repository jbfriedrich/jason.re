We in the IT industry in general, and me in particular, very much like to complain. A lot. The recent iPhone release, and the expected price increase, helped me quite a bit to deflate my head and return a bit closer to Earth.

I am in a remarkably privileged situation. I am very lucky, very fortunate, to be able to think about spending many people’s monthly net salary on a _phone_ , a _technical gadget_ , without restricting myself, or limiting other expenses in any way.

I am not a fan of any religion, so “Thank God” is out of the question. But I am thankful, very much so indeed.
