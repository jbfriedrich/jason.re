Netflix decided to raise thair prices *again!* It is so fucking annoying. Their content quality is going down, which means their viewer count is going down, so they have to milk their existing customers even more to make Wall Street happy.

I have cancelled for now, but will probably resubscribe to continue to watch True Crime and documentaries with my girlfriend. If it wasn't for that, I would cancel for good.
