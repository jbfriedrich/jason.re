I'm becoming increasingly reluctant to renew my Spotify Premium subscription for another year. They [paid out $10 billion in 2024](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/spotify-says-its-payouts-are-getting-better-but-artists-still-disagree/), but only the biggest artists and record companies [benefit from Spotify's streamshare model](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Streaming-study-Remuneration-models-favor-major-artists-10279072.html).  

Only **0,4%** of all artists on Spotify earn more than €10.000. On average, artists receive just **€0,003 per stream**—and songs with fewer than 1.000 annual streams aren't even counted. Of course, [this isn’t news](https://jason.re/post/what-is-music-worth-to-you/); it's been going on for years. Spotify has simply refined its algorithm over time to distribute payments to even fewer artists and distributors.  

I've always been [reluctant](https://jason.re/post/spotify/) to use music streaming services—and, in hindsight, rightly so. But after years of getting used to having nearly every song and album instantly available, how do I achieve independence again? How do I "go back"?

**Availability isn’t the issue**—there are plenty of alternatives for buying music. [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), [7Digital](https://de.7digital.com/), and even [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/de/new) still offer downloadable AAC files without DRM. The real problem is the cost: replacing my current Spotify library with purchased tracks would be expensive. I often listen to playlists with 50, 100, or even 250 tracks. That adds up to hundreds, if not thousands, of euros.  

I don’t have a perfect solution yet. I think I’ll start by cataloguing my old MP3 and FLAC library, checking what I already own, and begin pruning my Spotify collection. I’ll sort out which playlists, albums, and songs are *essential*, and which are just *nice to have*. Then I'll retrieve the tracks I want to keep, build a local database, and add information like purchase links and costs per song. After that, I’ll set a monthly budget and begin buying—album by album, song by song.  

This will take a while. I need to do some research, and I’m not the fastest coder (plus I have a day job and a life). Timing isn’t on my side—my subscription renews in August. But I’m determined to remove my dependency on Spotify in 2026.
