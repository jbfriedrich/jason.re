[Jason Friedrich](http://friedrich.uk) works what feels like ages in IT and has a mostly cynical view of the world. He has strong opinions, but [tries not to cling to them](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/work-matters/201002/strong-opinions-weakly-held-wisdom-the-courage-act-your-knowledge-and-the). He speaks of himself often in 3rd person, writes in English and native German and is located in the Ruhrgebiet area.

This is his chalkboard where the author makes up his mind and utters his opinion. Here he gathers his tech related documentation, writes about his experiences and tries new stuff.
