Back in January, Facebook and Google got caught [being very cozy with each other](https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-jedi-blue-ad-deal-165604926.html). They both looked very shady, and it seemed to be good ammunition for the antitrust lawsuit [they are](https://www.engadget.com/facebook-antitrust-ftc-48-states-194858668.html) currently [facing](https://www.engadget.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-204043354.html).

They found out now that [Google wrote a software](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/11/google-bernanke-revealed-in-ad-business-antitrust-lawsuit-error) called “Bernanke” to gain a major advantage over the competition. No one in their sane mind could think that there **is not** an [antitrust problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law) here. Being a buyer and a seller, at the same time, in the same system, reeks of corruption and illegal activities.

Facebook and Google need to be properly regulated, and with a hard hand, in my opinion. They were unregulated for far too long. It is time to get back some of that competition that they stomped out on their way to success.
