In the spirit of Christmas, and because they want to promote their new series "[Secret Level](https://www.amazon.de/gp/video/detail/B0DJPTJ1P6/)", Amazon felt generous and decided to gift a lot of games for free.

Look for yourself on their [landing page](https://gaming.amazon.com/home), but here is a list of games that I would recommend to get. You will need an account with [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) or [EPIC](https://store.epicgames.com/) to claim them. An be quick about it, some of them expire in the next 48 hours:
