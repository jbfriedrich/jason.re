I really, really wanted to ditch Google Chrome because of their constant [enshittification](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/08/02/googles-plan-to-drm-the-web-goes-against-everything-google-once-stood-for/) and their stance on [blocking ads](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23964509/google-manifest-v3-rollout-ad-blockers). But Safari makes it very hard for me to love it. The plugin system is far worse compared to Chrome, the UI feels wonky and the UX is average at best. I loved Safari's "iCloud Tabs" integration, but that is about it.

Now with the recent changes in iOS 17.4 to [comply with EU's Digital Markets Act](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu), it might be time to re-visit using Google Chrome as my main browser on the iPhone.

I also tried Firefox, but it is even challenged rendering my very tiny crappy blog. Don't get me wrong, Safari is challenged in that department too, but if I compare the rendering of Safari, Chrome and Firefox, Firefox is clearly the outlier, being often the only browser to render it "wrong" or just "differently".

I will take another look at Firefox in June, when the "Manifest v3 API" is live, and the ramifications and restrictions for ad blocking plugins is a bit more palpable for me.
