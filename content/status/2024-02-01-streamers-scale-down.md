Looks like a lot of big streamers on YouTube and Twitch finally realize that cranking out quality content and interesting videos at such a high frequency takes its toll. And that "always on" and "always engaging" is not sustainable long term. Expected it sooner, to be quite frank. But then the earnings were ridiculously high for those early in the game. But even for them it seems that no one is able to do it more than 10, 15 years max, before they either scale down or leave with depression and/or burnout.
