On May 2nd I started my new job with the [Axeda GmbH](http://www.axeda.de) here in Germany. The parent company, the [Axeda Corporation](http://www.axeda.com/), invited me over to the United States for two weeks to get to know the company headquarters, my new co-workers and of course the IT infrastructure we will maintain in both countries.

It was my first visit to the US, and it was really great! I hope there will be many more visits in the future.
