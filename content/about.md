My name is [Jason Friedrich](https://friedrich.uk). I am just another left-handed, binge-watching, tech geek who enjoys drinking coffee, playing video games and writing on the Internet. I've got my head stuck in the clouds [for a living](https://work.jason.re).

I tend to rant and growl... sometimes a lot… You will find my moods, thoughts and rants here. This is my pressure valve to vent some of my frustrations around people, (tech-)culture, tech and everyday life. It is my chalkboard where I make up my mind and utter my opinion. Here I gather my tech related documentation, write about my experiences and try new stuff.
