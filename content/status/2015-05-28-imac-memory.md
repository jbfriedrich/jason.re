Apples gives a maximum of 16 GB of memory for a 27-ich, mid-2011 iMac. The screenshot below proves them otherwise:

The iMac works fine with 32 GB of memory. I finally have a little bit of leeway to use [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion-pro) properly. Maybe Yosemite will even finally run smoothly now.
