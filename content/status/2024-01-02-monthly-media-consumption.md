I think I will steal [Carlo's idea](https://zottmann.org/2024/01/01/media-diet-december.html) and write about the media outlets I consume, the movies and shows I watch and the audiobooks, podcasts and music I listen to on a monthly basis. I did some ratings here and there on Mastodon, but could include them in these posts. That would make the most sense.
