[These are the decisions](https://tailscale.com/blog/sso-tax-cut) that motivate me to do my small part and support Tailscale with a subscription â€“ even though I would be perfectly fine "only" using their free tier. It always bothered me that I had to use Google, Microsoft, GitHub etc. to login. I'll probably run a self-hosted [Authentik instance](https://goauthentik.io/) and will switch my account over. That will be [more challenging than initially thought](https://hachyderm.io/@tailscale/112294372628920021), though. It seems they cannot switch accounts that initially used Apple or Github as IdP. I will get in touch with their support to see what my options are.
