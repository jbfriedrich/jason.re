YouTube, we need to talk. Seriously. Please get over here for a second.

First of all, I will never pay you 11,99 € per month. That is way too expensive. It is more than Disney+, and just a tiny bit less than Netflix. So please, for the love of God, stop shoving your fucking annoying promotion screens up my ass! It's never gonna happen, not with that price tag.

Second of all, fuck you. Seriously! You are as fucking annoying as TV in the “good ol' days”. Five or six ads in a 30-minute video, and the ads are playing louder than the original video. What the fuck is wrong with you? I know you do it [for the numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html), the 6bn ad revenue to finance the exec’s third boat must come from somewhere, right?

We are done, YouTube! Do you hear me? Until you come to your senses and offer the premium subscription for a sane price tag — or tone down the ads — we cannot even be friends anymore. I can watch the few longer videos that are of interest to me in another way — one that does not contain any ads at all.
