I think I could get used to ChatGPT. I played around with it a bit and in under an hour I was able to create a basic working Telegram bot that commits messages as status posts to my blog. It was a bit of bad luck that "[python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Transition-guide-to-Version-20.0)" just recently underwent a major code change in version 20. It was just not trained to these changes, and I had to use the transition guide to correct the code.

I am not a developer, it usually takes me a long time to start and I get discouraged very quickly as I have to constantly look up the basics over and over again. I just do not code enough to keep it all in memory. From now on I will use ChatGPT more often to create boilerplate code and to get over that dredged "starting at the blank page" hurdle.
