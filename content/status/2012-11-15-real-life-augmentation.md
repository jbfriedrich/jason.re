When I read news [like this](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/uk-man-amazing-new-robotic-arm-article-1.1198220), I begin to think that we are not so far away from the future depicted in [DeusEx: Human Revolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5KWLqUewc).

> I have been blown away by the robotic hand, I could sit and watch it all day. I feel like the Terminator. […] Prior to this I used prosthetic limbs provided by (England’s National Health Service) which were horrible.

The geek in me almost instantly thinks about [Luke’s mechanical hand](http://www.harrr.org/robotpower/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/LukeHand.jpg) or the famous scene in [Terminator II](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAr8llumKnY). Yes, I might exaggerate a bit. But the [invention](http://bebionic.com) of this prosthetic seems to me like a real breakthrough in robotics/bionics and also seems to improve it’s wielders quality of life.
