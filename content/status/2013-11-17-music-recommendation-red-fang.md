A co-worker of mine made me aware of this awesome band, called "[Red Fang](http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Fang)". I got immediately hooked and got their albums "[Whales and Leeches](http://redfang.bandcamp.com/album/whales-and-leeches-deluxe-version)", "[Murder the Mountains](http://redfang.bandcamp.com/album/murder-the-mountains-deluxe-edition)" and "[Red Fang](http://redfang.bandcamp.com/album/red-fang)".

Especially the song 'Wires' caught my attention. Not sure why, but I think it is the heavy, full and aggressive sound of the bass guitar and guitars that I feel sounds really great.
