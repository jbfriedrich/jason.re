When Apple unveiled their new [Apple Studio](https://www.apple.com/de/mac-studio/) and [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/de/studio-display/) on [March 8](https://www.apple.com/de/apple-events/march-2022/), everyone was eager to get the hardware into their hands.

* Would they be able to dupe the competition **again** with their superior hardware design? Or would it "just" be more of the same?
* Will we see another insane performance increase?
* Will the hefty price tag of the new hardware be justified?

It seems that the media embargo is up and the first tests are out. My take so far: 

* Apple Studio üëç
* Apple Studio Display üëé

I think the display is way overpriced, especially when you think about the fact that you need to spend an additional 460 ‚Ç¨ for an tilt- and height-adjustable (i.e. ergonomic) stand. This is a "must" in my opinion and I cannot comprehend why the fuck Apple does not include this stand as a default. But that would be sane, and it would rob them of their juicy revenue, I guess.

But I wish I had a real use case for the Apple Studio. Even though I find the hardware design somewhat repulsive, it packs so much of a punch, I would love to have it for the "techporn" factor alone.

Here are the reviews I watched, make up your own mind üòÅ:
