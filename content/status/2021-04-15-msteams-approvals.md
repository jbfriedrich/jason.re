This is definitely [not the worst idea](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/streamline-requests-with-new-approval-features-in-microsoft/ba-p/2259871), Microsoft has ever had. Especially not if your company is all in on Office365. I still hate Teams, though. The whole concept feels wrong to me. But your mileage may vary.
