RedHat kept their promise and made "Ansible [Tower](https://www.ansible.com/tower)" Open-Source. The free version is called [AWX](https://www.ansible.com/awx-project-faq), and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ansible/awx). According to their announcement, the model for AWX is similar to the one for Fedora and RedHat — which works great for so many years now.

AWX will be developed by RedHat’s Ansible team and the Community. Every once in a while they will take a snapshot and use this as a basis for a new version of their product, called “Ansible Tower”.

The install [instructions](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/INSTALL.md) are quite clear and the [prerequisites](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/INSTALL.md#prerequisites) are easy to fullfill. I was able to build and deploy an AWX instance on my Macbook Pro in about 15 to 20 minutes. And I am truly no expert when it comes to containers and Docker!
