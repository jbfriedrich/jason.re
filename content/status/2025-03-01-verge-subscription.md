In addition to my [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/) subscription, I also just subscribed to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/). That should cover all my needs when it comes to tech news and tech journalism.

I would have loved to support a German news outlet, for example [Heise](https://www.heise.de) or [Golem](https://www.golem.de). But their reporting pales in comparison. It saddens me a bit, to see how irrelevant they have become. At least to me, but I am sure there are others who feel the same way â€“ I cannot be the only one.
