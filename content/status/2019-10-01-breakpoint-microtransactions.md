I thought about getting "[Ghost Recon: Breakpoint](https://ghost-recon.ubisoft.com/game/en-us/breakpoint)", but after reading this [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/dbav23/ghost_recon_breakpoint_first_look_monetisation/) and [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-s-microtransactions-explained-1838678464) posts, and watching the video below, I am seriously reconsidering. I guess I will wait it out and buy some kind of "Ultimate Edition" on sale in a year or so. The game will have matured, be patched and most of the content will be released by then.

I will wait and see what other reviewers write about the game, especially [ACG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9_x1DImhU-eolIay5rb2Q) and the [Games Podcast](https://www.gamespodcast.de/). And then make a final decision.
