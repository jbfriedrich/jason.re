Mozilla really is a laughable circus. Letting 60 people go but still have a [ridiculously expensive CEO](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/02/mozilla_in_2024_ai_privacy/). That is a hard pill to swallow. Now they [have found a new excuse](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/mozilla-downsizes-as-it-refocuses-on-firefox-and-ai-read-the-memo/) to neglect and "enshittify" their products instead of offering a good browser and email experience. Time will tell how well their AI endeavors will work out with their [data privacy ambitions](https://fortune.com/2024/02/08/mozilla-firefox-ceo-laura-chambers-mitchell-baker-leadership-transition/).
