<p>I am not what you would consider a &ldquo;Pro User&rdquo; for git. Not at all. I would classify myself as an intermediate user. But even as an intermediate user, things can get pretty ugly and inconvenient when you only rely on the standard Git console client.</p>
<p>When things got more complicated, I started to use <a href=https://www.gitkraken.com/>GitKraken</a>. It was available on all platforms, it had a nice overview about changes and I was quite happy for a while. But when they started to force a registration and login to use the (still free) client, I decided to move on.</p>
<p>There are a lot of Git Desktop Clients out there, but none of the free clients were quite to my liking. With a heavy heart, I decided to pay for <a href=https://git-tower.com>Git Tower</a>. At the time, Git Tower was not a subscription app, you could buy for a one time fee of 82,00 €. It was a bit pricy for my use case, sure, but the app was definitely worth it. Especially when that money supports a smaller, independent German company.</p>
<p>When they released version 3.0, they decided to switch to a <a href=https://www.git-tower.com/pricing/mac>subscription based model</a>. While there is nothing wrong with a subscription, especially as it is a more secure, and more stable revenue model for small and mid-size companies, I am not a fan for my particular use case. I am not a full-time developer and I am probably using only a very small subset of <a href=https://www.git-tower.com/blog/image-diffing-and-reflog/>features</a> Git Tower has to offer. I subscribed for a year, to support the company and because i really love the app. But as described, it is not worth it for me personally to pay 59,00 € a year going forward.</p>
<p>While Git Tower switched to a subscription based model, <a href=https://www.sublimehq.com/>SublimeHQ</a>, the creators of the editor <a href=https://www.sublimetext.com/>SublimeText</a> (which I really, really love), developed their own Git Client called <a href=https://www.sublimemerge.com/>SublimeMerge</a>. As the editor, the Git Client also <em>does not</em> require a subscription, but is sold for 99,00 € and comes with <a href=https://www.sublimehq.com/sales_faq>3 years or free updates</a>.</p>

<p>When my Git Tower subscription ends in July 2020, I will give SublimeMerge a try and see if the application will work for me. If not, <a href=https://git-fork.com/>Fork</a> matured a lot over the last two years, and I guess it will continue to do so. Until then, I will probably find a couple of other application that I can try out. Maybe I will also give GitKraken another try.</p>
