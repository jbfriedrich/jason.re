<p>Four weeks ago my <a href=http://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-lite/>Ubiquiti EdgeMax EdgeRouter Lite</a> decided it was a good idea to <a href=http://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/EdgeMax-500-Internal-Server-Error/m-p/980503>not start PHP anymore</a>. Some people would say ‘Good choice and good riddance’ — on a router appliance a web interface comes in handy once in a while though. A Ubnt community member was able to help me very quickly, though something was very fishy. I just recently upgraded the firmware on the router, so how could the file system got corrupted? Did something strange happen during the upgrade? — Not that I could remember.</p>
<p>One evening two weeks ago then I was debugging a VPN problem I encountered a massive packet loss. First I thought it was the remote server, or my Internet provider. Soon though I had to realize that the first hop, the little EdgeRouter, was losing 70% of all packages sent to it. Also 60% packet loss on the second hop. No web interface available, not SSH connection possible. I decided to reboot the device… it did not come back! My first thought was a <a href=https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/EdgeRouter-bricked-hanging-at-boot-Is-it-dead/td-p/400574>memory issue</a>, but I needed more information what was happening on the device. The lights were no help, everything looked normal. I connected a Cisco Serial Console Cable and found some kernel “Oops” during boot:</p>
<p>This really looked weird. I contacted <a href=http://www.ubnt.com/support/>Ubnt support</a>. I was told to press the famous ‘any key’ during boot, before the kernel was loaded, and then run some tests. First of all a memory test:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>Octeon ubnt_e100# mtest
Testing <span style=color:#ae81ff>80100000</span> ... 80ffffff:
Iteration: <span style=color:#ae81ff>6040</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It ran for a couple of hours, but showed no issue at all. Support then had the idea to use the <a href=http://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/EdgeMax-rescue-kit-now-you-can-reinstall-EdgeOS-from-scratch/m-p/514857/highlight/true#M12098>‘EdgeMax Rescue kit’</a> to re-install the router from scratch.</p>
<p>This unfortunately did not bring a solution either. But it helped to identify the underlying problem. It looks like the filesystem corruption a few weeks back was just a herald of the problems that would I have to face soon:</p>
<p>It looks like the flash memory is totally fucked up. Since it was a little over a year old, and therefore still covered by the EU wide 2 year warranty, I contacted <a href=http://varia-store.com/>my reseller</a> and filed for RMA and sent the router back to them. I really hope that I will get a new device soon. It is a quite powerful little device, so I really miss it.</p>
