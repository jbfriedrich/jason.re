[John O’Nolan](http://john.onolan.org/about/) wrote an interesting [article](http://john.onolan.org/snapchat/) about how care-free the early use of Twitter was and how much it became kind of a burden in recent days.

> As Twitter grew, it changed from a public place where ad-hoc discussions around subjects happened, to a public place which represents your professional identity.We can’t just be ourselves on Twitter any more, mostly because there are lynch mobs around every corner waiting to hold us accountable. But only portraying a “professional subset” of your personality kills off the entire magic of what Twitter used to be.

I am very much agreeing with his assessment. Not that I will start using Snapchat now, but I decided to give my tweets an expiration date. From now on every tweet or re-tweet I make expires after 48 hours and is deleted from my timeline.
