It was clear that Apple would not roll over and comply with the new EU regulations. Of course they are trying to make it [as hard as possible](https://developer.apple.com/support/apps-using-alternative-payment-providers-in-the-eu/) for developers to not use their payment system and stick to the status quo.

I think the reduced comission between 10% and 17% is fair, the 3% payment processing fee maybe as well. But collecting a "core technology fee" for essentially doing nothing is wild. Can't wait for someone to sue them. Will take a couple of years, I guess, but I am sure it will be eventually struck down by the courts.
