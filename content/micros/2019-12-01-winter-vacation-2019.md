Every year I use my three week winter vacation to re-charge my batteries and to center myself. Gathering new strength to prepare for all challenges the next year will throw at me.

But this year is different. I feel mentally exhausted and very tired. I am reluctant in making decisions, cannot seem to find energy to start new side projects â€” or finally complete old ones. I do not want to do anything but sleep. 

I am not satisfied with my personal situation or with my professional life. My career seems to be stalling. When I look back at the last decade, I do not think I achieved anything worth mentioning. 

I cannot wait to start this year's winter vacation. Ten more work days to go!
