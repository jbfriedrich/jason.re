[Some food for thought](https://julien.danjou.info/p/why-stock-options-are-terrible-for). One definitely needs to be prepared if stock options or RSU enter the conversation as part of the salary or bonus structure. The german tax systems does not help either.

I tend to sell mine as soon as possible â€“ if the price is not incredibly low or at an all time low. I usually take the profits and invest them in some long-term funds.
