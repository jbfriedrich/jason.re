When I heard [Damian Lewis speak the lines of Antony at Caesar’s funeral](http://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2016/may/03/damian-lewis-antony-julius-caesar-friends-romans-countrymen-shakespeare-video), I immediately fell in love with Shakespeare again.

[The Guardian’s](http://www.theguardian.com/) video series "[Shakespeare Solos](http://www.theguardian.com/stage/series/shakespeare-solos)” is magnificent. All of them performed by extraordinary actors, with voices so remarkable that I can only sit here and listen, hanging on every syllable dropping from their lips as if nothing in the world matters anymore — and never will again.

I love all of the performances, but Damian Lewis' and Adrian Lester's voices will ring in my ears for quite some time.
