Another year, another E3. It is the biggest computer game expo in the US with a lot of hype, so of course everyone tweaked, enhanced and polished their trailers, cinematic and demos as much as possible. Take everything you see with a grain (a shitload) of salt. We don’t want to have another Witcher 3 debacle, right?!

These are the games that I am really looking forward to, based on the aforementioned demos and trailers:

# Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands

# Deus Ex: Mankind Divided

# Hitman

# Quantum Break

Remedy Entertainment decided not to present their game “Quantum Break” on the E3. As before in 2014, they will reveal their new trailers during Gamescom later this year. I am looking forward to it regardless.
