Very interesting [comments by Ian Betteridge](https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/04/01/antitrust-meta-apple-and-more/) on the antitrust actions from the US and the EU against Apple, Meta, and Google. A sight for sore eyes after [John Gruber's](https://daringfireball.net/) tremendously stupid takes on the [European Union's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) "[Digital Markets Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act)" (DMA)

> I paid Apple £1099 for my last iPhone. It made a handsome profit on it, probably between 30-40%. At that point, Apple should no longer be able to stop me from doing what the hell I want with the product I purchased. So yes, the fact that it does exactly that is problematic.

> As American companies are learning, the EU does not like companies that try and do an end run around the law. This appears to have dawned on Apple, which has already – in the space of a few weeks! – widened its plans to comply with the DMA and DSA. Perhaps not enough, which is why the EU is investigating them. But the mood from Apple has definitely started to change from sullen evasiveness to being more open to compliance. It’s not yet at the point of working to make a good compliant product for its customers, but it’s getting there.
