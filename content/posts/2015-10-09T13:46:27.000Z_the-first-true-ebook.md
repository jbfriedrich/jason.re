OK, it might not be the first "real eBook", but for me it is the first one I would buy **in addition** to the books I already have. JK Rowling and "Barnes & Noble" announced that they will release an "[Enhanced Edition](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/10/08Enhanced-Editions-of-Harry-Potter-Series-Now-Available-Exclusively-on-iBooks-for-iPhone-iPad-iPod-touch.html)" of the Harry Potter series, exclusively on Apple iBooks.

Though I do not like the exclusive release inside of a "fenced garden", their idea of Digital Content goes into the right direction. In my opinion, JK Rowling is the first author to create "advanced" digital content that uses the possibilities and features the iPad (or any other advanced tablet computer) has to offer.

All we need now to arrive in the future of digital publishing, is a DRM-free industry wide standard that supports animation, audio, video and comments.
