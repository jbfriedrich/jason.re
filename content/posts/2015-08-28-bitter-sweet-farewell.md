I am very sad today. As I always am in these bitter-sweet moments when I see smart, passionate and very talented people leave my team or even leave the company. You share a lot of memories with them, the good and the bad. I am not sure in which category the “12-hour customer upgrades” or the “huge outage at 3am in the morning” fall. Probably in both…

It’s even more sad that these goodbyes were not necessary. If only their potential would have been recognised and their talents been used in a proper way.

But I am also excited at the same time. These extraordinary people have an opportunity to broaden their horizon, to grow and to learn new things. That makes this departure so bitter-sweet.
