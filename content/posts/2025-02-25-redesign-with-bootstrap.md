title: Redesign with Bootstrap

I decided to clean up the blog, touch up some articles, remove Twitter references, make it more readable etc. Need to spend some more time on the cleanup, but that will do for now.

While doing that, I also changed the design a bit and went from my custom made CSS back to Bootstrap, due to features and better maintenance. I was not able to completely remove all custom CSS, but it is down to a minimum. 

Maybe one day I will get the Bootstrap source, fully customize and repack it, but not today. I am way too lazy to do that for a side project. One day, though! One day!

Some work is still left, not in order of priority:
- Review generation of RSS/Atom feed
- Gallery view inside a post with lightbox for 5 or 6 images
- Link posts, similar to [Simon Willison's "blogmarks"](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/)
- Easier navigation in the posts and updates section
- Local blog post search, probably using lunr.js
