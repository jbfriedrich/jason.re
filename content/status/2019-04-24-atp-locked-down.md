I have the same thought for the last couple of years, but I was never able to articulate it in a short and poignant way. In my opinion, [Marco Arment's comment](https://overcast.fm/+CdQwKWV0/1:04:00) is exactly on-point. The shift to mobile and mobile design dumbs down interfaces and removes "power users" from the equation. **Especially** on the Mac!
