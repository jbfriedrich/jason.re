To prepare myself for "Final Destination: Bloodlines", I decided to rewatch all existing "Final Destination" movies. Let me say this: I knew that I did not need to rewatch them to "better understand the plot", alright, they are no "silver screen classics", but I did not remember them to be THAT bad ðŸ˜‚.

Apart from the first one, in which the setups are pretty elaborate and the effects still look good, even though the movie is 25 years old, the rest of the movies are really not worth a rewatch.

The second one was "okayish", but after that, the CGI work was sloppy and they started the "one-upping", more spectacle, less elaborate setups.

I remember watching the first one in the cinema and later as DivX on two CDs. Yes, I feel old now... ðŸ˜ž.
