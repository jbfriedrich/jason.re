I love iTerm2 and I am using it for a couple of years now. I am using a lot of panes and a few tabs, but only rarely move them to a single window because I was never able to move them back. [Until now](http://azaleasays.com/2014/03/05/iterm2-merge-a-pane-back-to-window-or-tab-bar/)! Just hit `command + shift + option` and drag the body for the terminal window back. That was easy! I hope I can remember it.
