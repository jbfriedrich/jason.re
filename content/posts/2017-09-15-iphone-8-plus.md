When Apple first announced this year’s new phones, I immediately wanted to go for the [iPhone X](https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/). I was instantly sold on the idea of having an almost bezel-free OLED display, combined with the latest technology and one of the [best chipsets](http://www.androidauthority.com/apple-a10-fusion-chip-performance-723918/) on the market. And wireless charging? Please sign me up!

This morning though, I ordered an [iPhone 8 Plus](https://www.apple.com/iphone-8/) with 64 GB of memory.

After the initial excitement of the event was gone, and the usual euphoric hype on all media and social channels had faded, I started having doubts about my first assessment. People were talking about the weird placement of the [notch](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16306298/apple-iphone-x-screen-notch), about the [security of Face ID](https://www.troyhunt.com/face-id-touch-id-pins-no-id-and-pragmatic-security/) and the [gorgeous](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/hands-on-with-the-iphone-x-oled-and-hdr-outshine-everything-else/), but very [new](http://bgr.com/2017/09/11/iphone-x-specs-oled-display-burn-in/) OLED display. In addition, I found that not only the [prices for iPhones in Europe](http://mashable.com/2017/09/13/iphone-x-prices-europe/#TVu8ojmZFOqD) had sky-rocketed, but also the price for [Apple Care+](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/12/16297886/applecare-plus-iphone-x-199-price-increase) had been steeply increased — even more so in Europe and Germany.

All these factors, combined with this excellent tech [comparison](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-x-vs-iphone-8-vs-8-plus-tech-specs/) changed my mind. The iPhone 8 fulfils all my needs and is a huge improvement over my battered, but sturdy, iPhone 5s.

It is the conservative choice. Let the early adopters battle with the [UX changes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcochiappetta/2017/09/14/the-iphone-x-is-going-to-alienate-long-time-iphone-users-and-apple-purists/#19db472a437e), the new hardware, and the new authentication system. Instead of getting the “Point Zero Release”, I will wait for the next one. The one where all kinks have been worked out.
