Watched the first episode of Ken Burns' ["The Dust Bowl"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dust_Bowl_(miniseries)) documentary. Holy shit, I did not know it was THAT long and THAT severe. Very impressive pictures and tales from survivors.

I have to say though, you immediately experience all stereotypes of a typical PBS documentary. While I definitely appreciate the thorough, factual and unexcited style – very untypical for the usual American content – it really could be far less dry and sometimes even less lenghty and boring.

But overall, I would definitely recommend the documentary. I will check out some of other Ken Burns documentaries, especially the one about cancer.
