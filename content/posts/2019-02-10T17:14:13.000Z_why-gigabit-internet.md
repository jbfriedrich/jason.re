Whenever I say that I would love to have Gigabit Internet, or at least 500 Mbit up- and downstream, people tend to ask me "What in the world would you do with such a high bandwidth?!" Let me play you the song of my people...

{{< src="https://rmbr.eu/file/dstore/19/2/oliver-twist-bandwidth.jpg" >}}

I have around 20 [TB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte) of data that I would like to back up from my local [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage). I would love to have an encrypted backup outside the house. And with _The Cloud™_ on everyone's lips, it should be very easy to move your backup up there, right? Right?!

Well... not quite...

I have an [upstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_\(networking\)) bandwidth of 20 [Mbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabit), which is generally about 2 [MB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte) per second. This means that I can back up 120 MB per minute, 7200 MB per hour and a whopping 172800 MB – or around 172 [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) – per day.

This means, even if I was to upload constantly without doing anything else – which is quite theoretical, as you always need some bandwidth when you use the Internet – it would take about **116,5 days** of straight uploading. That number[1] is fucking ridiculous.

This is why _we_ need Gigabit Internet, upstream **and** downstream! Not only one direction!

[^1]: With 500 Mbit, it would be 62 MB per second, 3,7 GB per minute, 223,2 GB per hour and 5,4 TB a day. With 1000 Mbit / 1 Gbit roughly twice that much.
