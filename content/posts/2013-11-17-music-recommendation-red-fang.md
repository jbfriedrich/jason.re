A co-worker of mine made me aware of this awesome band, called ‘[Red Fang](http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Fang)‘. I got immediately hooked and purchased all their albums on ‘[Bandcamp](http://redfang.bandcamp.com)‘:

* [Whales and Leeches](http://redfang.bandcamp.com/album/whales-and-leeches-deluxe-version)
* [Murder the Mountains](http://redfang.bandcamp.com/album/murder-the-mountains-deluxe-edition)
* [Red Fang](http://redfang.bandcamp.com/album/red-fang)

Especially the song ‘Wires’ and the according video caught my attention. Not sure why, but I think it is the heavy, full and aggressive sound of the bass guitar and guitars that I feel sounds really great.
