This is kind of an end of an era. Google [is killing](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/google-search-kills-off-cached-webpages/) its website cache feature. On that scale I am sure it safes a pretty penny in storage costs. I donâ€˜t think that the Internet Archive is able to absorb this loss of cache data.
