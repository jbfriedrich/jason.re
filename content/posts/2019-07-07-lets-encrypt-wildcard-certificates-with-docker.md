In the past I used a self-built Docker container that was running easy-rsa with a customized openssl.cnf file. This got very annoying, very quickly, as I needed to import my private CA to all systems I wanted to use it on.

A couple of weeks back I decided to use one of my domains, _frdr.ch_ , to use for my internal systems. This means, only the main domain _frdr.ch_ will be exposed to the outside word, all other entries will only be available on the internal DNS server that overrides the required local entries.

Since the domain itself is public, and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) offers [Wildcard Certificates](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-and-wildcard-certificate-support-is-live/55579) for a while now, I decided to go that route and finally ditch my [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) solution. This also would allow me to automate the certificate creation/renewal with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and keep the operational overhead to a minimum.

Before I roll my own solution, I wanted to see if someone already came up with a good solution. And I was lucky. I found [Adrien Ferrand's](https://github.com/adferrand) [solution](https://github.com/adferrand/docker-letsencrypt-dns) that is using Docker, Certbot and [Lexicon](https://github.com/AnalogJ/lexicon).

## Creating the required configuration files

For easier backups, my Docker servers use bind volumes whenever possible. This makes deploying my configuration files rather easy.

```
$ mkdir /opt/docker-sync/le-dns
$ cd /opt/docker-sync/le-dns
$ vim domains.conf
  *.frdr.ch frdr.ch
$ vim lexicon.yml
  # Content of /etc/letsencrypt/lexicon.yml
  delegated: frdr.ch
  inwx:
    auth_username: username
    auth_password: super_secret_password
```

## Building your own Docker Image (optional)

To be as independent as possible, I like to fork projects and build my own Docker Images. This is not required though, it can work out-of-the-box with Adrien's repository.

```
$ docker build --no-cache --force-rm -t <redacted>.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/le-dns:latest -t <redacted>.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/le-dns:1.3 .

2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |  - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |    /etc/letsencrypt/live/frdr.ch/fullchain.pem
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |    Your key file has been saved at:
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |    /etc/letsencrypt/live/frdr.ch/privkey.pem
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |    Your cert will expire on 2019-10-05. To obtain a new or tweaked
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |    version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |    again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |    "certbot renew"
2019-07-07 09:32:50 [19] |  - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

2019-07-07 09:32:51 [19] | ok
```

If you leave the container running, it will check twice a month with _Let's Encrypt_ and renew the certificate if required. Should you need a PFX export of your certificate, set the `PFX_EXPORT=true` and the `PFX_EXPORT_PASSPHRASE="super secret password"` environment variables.

## Certificate Renewal

Since the certificate changes every 3 months with each renewal, I need to find a way to distribute that new certificate to all the places that need it. I am not 100% how to deal with that yet, but I already have some ideas.
