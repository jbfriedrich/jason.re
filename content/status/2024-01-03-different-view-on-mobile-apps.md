While reading through my feed reader, I found the following quote from [Cory Doctorow](https://doctorow.medium.com/the-open-web-is-good-actually-9683c692df84#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAn%20app%20is%20just%20a%20web%2Dpage%20wrapped%20in%20enough%20IP%20to%20make%20it%20a%20crime%20to%20defend%20yourself%20against%20corporate%20predation%E2%80%9D):

> "An app is just a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make it a crime to defend yourself against corporate predation."

I usually find him very annoying, but there are a lot of apps out there where this is true.
