Today a meteorite [hit a part of Russia](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2013/feb/15/meteorite-explosion-russia-in-pictures?intcmp=122). Several hundred people were injured. Not directly because of the meteorite itself, but because of the shattering glass and broken window parts generated by the meteoriteâ€™s shockwave. As far as I know, it is the first time that we have this many videos of a natural spectacle of this scale.

We are very lucky to have this much video footage. The reason for it are the Russian insurance companies. In case of a claim, it is not uncommon that a company denies payment or wants additional proof. So people install dashboard cameras in their cars.

It looks amazing but is also very scary. Just imagine what would happen if a meteorite ten times as big would hit Earth. A scary thought indeed.
