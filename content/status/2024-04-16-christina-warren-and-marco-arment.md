Christina Warren and Marco Arment are spot-on about the current situation of the Apple Vision Pro. 

[Marco Arment](https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment/112276737971654878) on Mastodon:

> The challenge Apple faces with AVP is getting enough people to buy (and keep using) a device type that they weren't already buying (headsets), which is VERY expensive and limited, to accumulate enough customers for the content and software ecosystem to develop.

[Christina Warren](https://mastodon.social/@film_girl/112278501767565554) puts an even finer point on it:

> Spot on. And I'll add: It’s also a dev kit positioned as a consumer product, priced as an enterprise/industrial tool but without any of the features that enterprise/industry can use. The whole thing remains a mess and no amount of “whataboutism” or iPhone comparisons, as if we aren't living in a different time, will change the fact that this thing is DOA in its current form and positioning.

To me, at this point, it is a nice piece of "tech porn". A remarkable device that shows a certain direction - but nothing more.
