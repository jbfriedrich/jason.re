Finally finished Mafia 3. Despite all it’s problems and bugs – even on the PS4 – I really liked the story and the voice actors. I will probably buy the DLC’s in a sale though. If you can get the game and it’s DLC packs later for around 20 EUR, I recommend buying it. Might write a detailed review later this month.
