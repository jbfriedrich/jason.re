A couple of days ago the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/11/18/how-a-star-wars-video-game-faced-charges-that-it-was-promoting-gambling/) wrote an article about EA’s Battlefront 2. It was the first time I read something this thorough and detailed about a game and its mechanics in a general media publication — and not in a gaming blog or podcast.

After some countries in Europe already started investigating several games for loot boxes and gambling, it seems that Hawaii will be the [first state](https://kotaku.com/hawaii-wants-to-fight-the-predatory-behavior-of-loot-1820664617) to do so in the US. I hope, that many other states will join them and that this lootbox madness will be phased out of the games rather quickly now.
