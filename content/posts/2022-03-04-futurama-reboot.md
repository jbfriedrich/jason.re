There was not much good news in 2021 or 2022, so the message that [Futurama will be rebooted](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/futurama-revived-at-hulu-1235090020/amp/) and have another at least one other season over at Hulu, left the Internet in a huge buzz. 

The original cast would reprise their roles, with one unfortunate exception: John DiMaggio was initially not on board. It seems that after some lengthy renegotiations, he [has now joined](https://collider.com/futurama-reboot-john-dimaggio-bender-returning-new-contract/) the rest of the cast.

I am very happy about that. Futurama is one of my most favorite shows. I think to celebrate its return, I need to finally get this [Bender model](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/bender-futurama-bigovereasy-2). 

Futurama influenced Internet and pop culture in such a tremendous way, that it left a little bit of a void when it went off the air (even though it had one of the best series endings ever).
