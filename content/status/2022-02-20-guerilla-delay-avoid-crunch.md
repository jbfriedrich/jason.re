It is nice to read that a game studio director seems [to care about his employees](https://www.thegamer.com/horizon-forbidden-west-delayed-crunch/) — and it doesn't seem to be empty words either.

I hope that this will be an early turning point in the industry, that other big publishers and developers follow suit and refrain from crunching.

Gamers are a fickle bunch, but they can wait the six months. I don't mind waiting longer for games to be released, but I hate it when publishers announce a release date — while they are fully aware that that they can't keep that date — and then "surprisingly" move it six to twelve months into the future.

Just give the real release date right from the start and stop bullshitting your customers.
