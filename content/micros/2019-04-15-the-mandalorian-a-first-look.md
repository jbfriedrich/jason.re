Disney presented "[The Mandalorian](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-mandalorian-exclusive-footage-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration-chicago-panel/)" on the [Star Wars Celebrations](https://www.starwarscelebration.com/) this weekend. After a disappointing [Episode IX teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adzYW5DZoWs) and an even worse title, this new series and its premise at least _looks_ interesting. We will see if and when the new Disney+ Streaming channel reaches Germany.
