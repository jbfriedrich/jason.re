[Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/04/26/feedbin-email-newsletter-emails/) had a great idea:

> Rather than using the Feedbin email address directly (look under Settings > General > Sources for yours), use an intermediary email address. I set up a Gmail email just for this, and have it auto-forward to my Feedbin email. Then when I sign up for a newsletter, I use: new-secret-email+specific-newsletter@gmail.com

I use [Feedbins newsletter feature](https://feedbin.com/blog/2016/02/03/subscribe-to-email-newsletters-in-feedbin/) for quite a while, but also have some sites that ban feedbin email addresses. I will create a newsletter email address for such occasions.

It looks like the newsletter feature [has been quite improved](https://feedbin.com/blog/2024/04/25/custom-newsletter-addresses/). It is now similar to Apple's "Hide My Email" and Fastmail's "Masked Email" services! That is a most welcome change. 

Moving to and paying for Feedbin was one of my best decisions when it comes to digital services.
