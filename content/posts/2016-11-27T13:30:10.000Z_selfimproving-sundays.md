Every Sunday I try to do something against my self-identified knowledge gaps and learn either something new, or make an attempt to get a deeper understanding of a certain topic.

This week (like last week) it is Python. I want to be more fluent in it, learn some more advanced topics like OOP and Django, as well as understanding some of the basics I seem to have missed so far. I came across [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) a couple of week back and was able to get a lot of courses in a sale. I can only recommend the [‘Complete Python Bootcamp’](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) course – especially when you already have some Python knowledge.

We will see what it is next Sunday. I doubt that I will run out of things to improve. I need to re-visit some old projects, have ideas for some new ones as well. I also have to explore [‘Safari Books Online’](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/our-library/) some more, as their library is so huge that you freeze in awe when you log in for the first time.

“No rest for the wicked!”
