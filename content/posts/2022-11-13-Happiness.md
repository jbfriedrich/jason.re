The current state of Twitter saddens me very much üíî.

Not because it was an important news source for me, no. Without Twitter I would have never met one of *the* most important people in my life. And I am so *grateful* to have found her.

She is such improvement to my small little world. Enriches it with new *flavors* and new *ideas*. Challenges my long-held *viewpoints*, makes me think about the *world* and the *universe* ‚ù§Ô∏è.

I think I need to remove my pinned tweet from my Twitter profile. Even though I still believe that *happiness* is nothing that can be achieved all the time, non-stop, 24x7. I also *know* that besides being [*busy*, *tormented*, *interested* and *challenged*](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy), there is ***happiness***. She makes me ***happy!***

I ***love*** and ***cherish*** her. Late at night, lost in deep conversations, ensnared by those beautiful eyes, only disrupted by enticing kisses or her delightful laugh. I could do that for an eternity ‚Äì or even longer.

Indeed, I could do that.
