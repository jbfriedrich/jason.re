Today I learned, that there will be a [pigeon skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareIII/comments/1b4xfmj/pigeon_skin/) in "[Call of Duty - Modern Warfare](https://www.callofduty.com/de/modernwarfare)". It will likely cost between $20 and $30. It seems that monetization really knows no bounds these days - not matter how stupid or overpriced. You can get a real pigeon for that much money. [Yes, really](https://www.deine-tierwelt.de/kleinanzeigen/tauben-c89544/)!
