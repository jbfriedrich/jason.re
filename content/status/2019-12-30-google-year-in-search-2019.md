Interesting how people turn to “heroes” in times like these. It is no coincidence that superhero movies and tv shows are en-vogue, people need symbols that inspire them. But sadly, there are not many “leaders” left that exude confidence or hope or even competence — no matter the field in society: thought leaders, political leaders, good examples or otherwise.
