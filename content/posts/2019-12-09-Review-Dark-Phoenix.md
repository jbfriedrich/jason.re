From the first minute the movie feels very “constructed” and very “artificial” to me. As if they discovered the comic book story and then decided they want to build a movie around it.

They have a great cast of actors, but they seem to read their uninspired and very descriptive text from a teleprompter, and have left their mimics at home. Strongly reminding me of Hayden Christiansen's performance as Anakin Skywalker. 

It's a shame the X-Men series had such a rapid decline in quality. It's not even worth the 3,99 € rental price. 👎
