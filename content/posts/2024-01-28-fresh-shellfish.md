Nice, [fish-shell 3.7.0](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/relnotes.html#fish-3-7-0-released-january-1-2024) has been released. It feels much quicker on the MacBook Air, not sure if it is real or just subjectively perceived, but I'll take that fresh "out of the box" feeling.

The release contains a lot of improvements and fish is now way more compatible to "good ol' bash", for which I have retained so much [muscle memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory), as it was my default shell for so many years.
