Fort Nowhere finally released their version of Bob Dylan's iconic song "The Times They are A-Changing" that was used in the [season three trailer of "The Crown"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLXYfgpqb8Ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLXYfgpqb8A). I immediately fell in love with the song and now I can finally listen to it all-day on repeat üòÅ.
