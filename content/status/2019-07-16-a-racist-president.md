A very good [opinion piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-conway-trump-is-a-racist-president/2019/07/15/b13c0bd4-a740-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html) in the Washington Post.

> Telling four non-white members of Congress — American citizens all, three natural-born — to “go back” to the “countries” they “originally came from”? That’s racist to the core. It doesn’t matter what these representatives are for or against — and there’s plenty to criticize them for — it’s beyond the bounds of human decency. For anyone, not least a president.

Every Republican politician who is not speaking up is silently approving this behavior. And with their inaction, they are supporting racism and should be ashamed of being a citizen of the United States.
