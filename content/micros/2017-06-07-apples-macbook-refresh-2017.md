[Summary and comparison](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11519/apple-updates-mac-laptops-pro-vanilla-air-all-get-new-cpus) of all new models and options. I am a bit disappointed by Apple. Now everything is on Kay Lake, the ultra-portable MacBook now supports up to 16 GB of RAM. But a 32 GB option for the MacBook Pro’s is nowhere in sight. I still hope it will be a “silent update” in the fall.
