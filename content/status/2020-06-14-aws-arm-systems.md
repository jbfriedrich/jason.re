Everyone and their dog are now offering ARM system in their portfolio. [Amazon now, too](https://siliconangle.com/2020/06/11/amazons-new-c6g-r6g-arm-based-instances-now-available/). I think these are only really useful with certain workload types like AI, ML, these sort of things. Wondering how much demand there really is for these kind of systems, and if they make a profit for Amazon ðŸ¤”.
