I was very surprised to see [VultR](https://www.vultr.com/) offering Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016. To my knowledge, it is the only VPS provider to do so. There is an additional monthly fee for the license, but the price is quie tolerable in my opinion.

You donâ€™t have to buy the license yourself and the instance is almost instantly available. A great option especially when you only need the VPS for a limited amount of time. That being said, I would love to see an option to use your own license. But I guess this is a no-go, as Microsoft would need to open their internal systems to third parties and offer some kind of API to check for license validity.
