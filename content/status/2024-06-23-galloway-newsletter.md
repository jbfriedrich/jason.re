Another interesting newsletter. This time it is "No Mercy / No Malice" by [Scott Galloway](https://www.linkedin.com/in/profgalloway/). I am sure I am late to the party… again! His [latest edition](https://www.profgalloway.com/ai-laundromat/) about AI has some very interesting food for thought:

> Back to NVDA. Think about this: One company has added the value of the global auto industry and the GDP of Sweden in 12 months. OpenAI, and by extension its sugar daddy, Microsoft, are similarly benefitting. But investor hunger for AI stories can’t be sated by a few businesses. CNBC makes an annual list of the 50 most disruptive companies, and two-thirds of the entrants on the 2024 list “describe artificial intelligence as ‘critical’ to their businesses.” The key word in that sentence is “describe.” Every comms exec and CEO who can spell “AI” (i.e., all of them) has decided Ai is the protagonist of their company’s story. However, similar to Game of Thrones, a lot of these leading men and women aren’t going to make it to Season 2.

Thanks to [Scheinprobleme](https://bsky.app/profile/scheinprobleme.bsky.social) for mentioning his Newsletter over at BlueSky.
