My name is [Jason Friedrich](https://friedrich.uk). I am just another left-handed, tech loving geriatric millenial who enjoys drinking coffee, playing video games and writing on the Internet. I am a make-believe writer and compendium of useless movie & tv show facts. I yell at [clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) for a living.

On this blog you will find my moods, thoughts and rants. It is my pressure valve to vent some of my frustrations around people, technology, (tech-)culture and everyday life. It is my chalkboard where I make up my mind and utter my opinion. Here I gather my tech related documentation, write about my experiences and try new stuff.
