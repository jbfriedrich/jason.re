The prude Americans did it! They [successfully removed](https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/31/sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta/) all the "smudge" from the Internet! 🎉 Of course, they didn't really clean it up and got rid of all the "filth". They just swept it under the rug. Couldn't have any side-effects, could it?

> Stories with the word "porn" in them are important because they're about censorship, sexual health, business trends, sex work, politics, gender and women. They're about people.

Oh well.. 🤷🏻‍♂️
