After seven years (at least, the oldest email I could find was from 2008) I cancelled my [Sipgate](http://www.sipgate.de) account today. My main reason for getting Sipgate in the first place was the “pdf to fax” feature, which got pretty unreliable over the past 2 years or so. Either the fax arrived completely distorted or it did not arrive at all. As I have not used the Sipgate VoIP landline for the last 3 years, the last reason to keep the account is gone now.
