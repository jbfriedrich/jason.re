Nice, Atlassian has released [their study](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/distributed-work/distributed-work-report) on remote work. It clearly shows what a great asset it can be. Every company forcing their people back to an office use a backwards-oriented management style and do not understand what a modern workforce of the 21st century needs and wants! That is a hill I am willing to die on!
