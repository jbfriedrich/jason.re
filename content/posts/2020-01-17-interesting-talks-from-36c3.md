Every year between Christmas and New Year, the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) is hosting its annual congress. Since 2018 it is held on Leipzig, it had to move a couple of times as attendance grew a lot.

I don't know if I am getting old, or if the talks get less interesting every year. But if you look through my old posts, you will see that this year has the least amount of videos that I found interesting.
