I would have never thought that I would enjoy "World of Warcraft" again after quitting the game [in 2009](https://jason.re/status/20090723025456/). But the "Dragonflight" expansion is really fun. I hated the first starting region, but it picks up a lot of speed after that and has a captivating (enough) story for me to continue. Now I am invested and want to see how the story ends. And I have a group of people who would go into a dungeon with me - if the story would require to complete one!
