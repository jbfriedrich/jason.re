A little experiment. Twitter gets worse and worse. Not only the technical aspects of this platform seems to be in free fall right now, also it seems to to me as if Twitter is more and more visited by the ‘mob with torches’.

What I mean with that is, that an increasing number of spam bots and negative, criticising ‘know-it-alls’ are populating Twitter at the moment. At times it is unbearable. People criticising and raging just for the sake of venting their ‘anger’ — which is in 99 % of all occurrences completely artificial and not a real expression of outrage at all. Real content, like news, interesting information, little stories or jokes became a minority on this platform. Instead I get rages about a shows they do not have to watch, or the reasons why this special product — they do not use — sucks donkey balls. They rage fast, they rage a lot and complain about anything.

So I asked myself one question: For what do I use Twitter nowadays?

I use it mostly for getting news about e-sports and to follow a handful people that I personally know or that provide useful information on topics I am interested in. The rest is annoyance. So I will temporarily shut down my Twitter account to see if I can get the little information it provides from other sources. Let’s see how that works out over the next couple of weeks.
