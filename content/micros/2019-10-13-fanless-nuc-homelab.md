My Intel NUC home lab is finally fan-less. In the summer months, with air temperatures of 30˚ to 40˚C, the small fans were spinning almost all day. Especially with the older models. Nevermore!

I finally decided to get Akasa cases for the NUC. As they are sitting on one of my desks, I decided to go with the Plato line. The X7D for the NUC7i5BNH, the X7 for the NUC7i7DNHE and the X8 for the NUC8i7BEH.
