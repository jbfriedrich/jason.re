Plex seems to now have a bit better IPv6 support. I think it is still not 100%, as it should be in 2024 – which is a shame. But at least now I can put an IPv6 network in the "LAN networks" setting and that network is treated as local network. Before it went out and back in, and also asked for authentication multiple times – which it should not on local network.
